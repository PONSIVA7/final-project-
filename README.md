## Project Description
Every quarter, CS106B students dread learning recursion and pointers, arguably the two hardest concepts in CS106B. We're excited to develop see++, a C++ memory visualization tool, to help students better understand how code affects memory. see++ lets students watch their code execute line by line, updating local variables as well as heap memory, helping them understand pointers in much greater detail.

Ultimately, see++ will help students understand pointers, the stack, and the heap in more detail and even debug their own code that manipulates linked lists and trees.

Below is an example of a visualization possible with our interface:
