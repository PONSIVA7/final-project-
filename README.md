## Project Description
Every quarter, CS106B students dread learning recursion and pointers, arguably the two hardest concepts in CS106B. We're excited to develop see++, a C++ memory visualization tool, to help students better understand how code affects memory. see++ will let students watch their code execute line by line, updating local variables as well as heap memory, helping them understand pointers in much greater detail.

A mock prototype of the types of memory diagrams see++ will generate is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WHp0F-IZ2xwAXuoHmd8ebmyjwxNuq7zXH3J81VJcCoI). Ultimately, see++ will help students understand pointers, the stack, and the heap in more detail and even debug their own code that manipulates linked lists and trees.
